# A Beautiful Journey Through Introductory Calculus
This project, led by me, Prakash Pant, in collaboration with my friend Saurab Banstola, was developed during our gap year (2024/2025). Our goal was to create a comprehensive, accessible, and offline-friendly textbook based on the popular calculus course by David Easdown. This book aims to serve as a self-contained resource for anyone interested in learning introductory calculus, especially in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. We've worked meticulously to ensure that the content is not only aligned with the course material but also enriched with additional explanations, examples, and exercises to deepen understanding. Our hope is that this textbook will provide a valuable educational tool for learners in diverse environments, helping to bridge the gap in regions where access to online resources may be challenging.
